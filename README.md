So this is a SAMD21 build template. just `make` in the this directory, and the `build` directory will provide you project bins.
To configure source selection, edit config.mk and include all the libraries/code you wish to use.
To configure Board/Clock config edit header files in `conf/`.
I probably broke doxygen. Sorry.
